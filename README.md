# hello-world
Hello Open-Source-Community,

This is Bereket, though i started programming in c while studying for my first degree, in 2003. I never had a chance to explore it deeply up untill now. Open source community has finally helped me find my way into what I had for so long wanted to do. Now I am studying python and django framework to develope web APIs. Most importantly learning to collaborate through GitHub
